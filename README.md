## Hey there, I'm Amit ðŸ‘‹


### About me
At my current company, I play a hybrid role of Finance Operations Manager and a Product Owner for a customized ticketing platform. I enjoy anything data-related from building financial models, strategic dashboards, to story-telling visualizations - basically any opportunity where I can bring people, ideas and data together in one place.  I'm also a part-time graduate student at Stevens Institute of Technology studying Computer Science.  In my free time, I love biking, spending time outdoors, traveling and exploring different countries and cultures.

- ðŸŒ± FUN FACT: The first language which I used "Hello World" with was Java.   While I'm not an engineer by profession, I still enjoy learning about CS and building cool things in my free time.
