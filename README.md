## Hey there, I'm Amit ðŸ‘‹


### About me
Currently, I work in a hybrid role finance/data analytics for a simulation software company. I enjoy anything data-related from building financial models, strategic dashboards, to story-telling visualizations - basically any opportunity where I can bring people, ideas and data together in one place.  In my free time, I love biking, spending time outdoors, traveling and exploring different countries and cultures.

- âš¡ FUN FACT: While I'm not an engineer by profession, I still enjoy learning about CS and building cool things in my free time.

- ðŸŒ± LEARNING: I'm currently learning more about SQL and database query optmization using postgreSQL
