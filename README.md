## Hey there, I'm Amit ðŸ‘‹

### About me
I'm a Finance Operations manager with a love for data. I love anything data-related from building financial models, strategic dashboards, to story telling.  I'm also a part-time graduate student at Steven's Institute of Technology studying Computer Science.  In my free time, I love biking and spending time outdoors.  I love traveling and exploring different countries and cultures when I can.

- ðŸŒ± FUN FACT: The first language which I used "Hello World" with was Java.   While I'm not an engineer by profession, I still enjoy learning about CS and appreciate the broard spectrum of areas which CS touches.
