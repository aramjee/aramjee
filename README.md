## Hey there, I'm Amit ðŸ‘‹

### About me
I'm a Finance manager with a passion for data. I enjoy anything data-related from building financial models, strategic dashboards, to story-telling visualizations.  I'm also a part-time graduate student at Stevens Institute of Technology studying Computer Science.  In my free time, I love biking, spending time outdoors, traveling and exploring different countries and cultures.

- ðŸŒ± FUN FACT: The first language which I used "Hello World" with was Java.   While I'm not an engineer by profession, I still enjoy learning about CS and appreciate the broard spectrum of areas which CS touches.
